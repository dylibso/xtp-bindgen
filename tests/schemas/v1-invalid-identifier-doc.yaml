exports:
  invalid@Func:
    description: |
      This demonstrates how you can create an export with
      no inputs or outputs.
  "invalid invalid":
    description: |
      This demonstrates how you can accept or return primtive types.
      This function takes a utf8 string and returns a json encoded boolean
    input:
      type: string
      description: A string passed into plugin input
      contentType: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    output:
      type: boolean
      description: A boolean encoded as json
      contentType: application/json
  referenc/eTypeFunc:
    description: |
      This demonstrates how you can accept or return references to schema types.
      And it shows how you can define an enum to be used as a property or input/output.
    input:
      contentType: application/json
      "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Fruit"
    output:
      contentType: application/json
      "$ref": "#/components/schemas/ComplexObject"
imports:
  eatA:Fruit:
    description: |
      This is a host function. Right now host functions can only be the type (i64) -> i64.
      We will support more in the future. Much of the same rules as exports apply.
    input:
      contentType: text/plain; charset=utf-8
      "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Fruit"
    output:
      type: boolean
      description: boolean encoded as json
      contentType: application/json
components:
  schemas:
    Fruit:

    ComplexObject:
      description: A complex json object
      properties:
        "gh ost":

          description: I can override the description for the property here
